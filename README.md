# Zvezdolov

Zvezdolov ("Starcatcher") is a device for measuring stellar
brightness. I consists of a LED light mounted on a fishpole and
control knobs for adjusting the color and brightnes of the light. The
fishpole serves to keep the light as far away as practical from the
user, thus making it more similar to a point source. The user orients
the fishpole so that the light is visually near a star and adjusts the
color and brightness to match the star. A display on the control board
shows the apparent magnitude of the star.

This repository contains work in progress on a color version of such a
device. The previous prototype used a white LED and would not work
well on reddish stars. Currently, the circuit design is complete, but
untested. There is no software yet because the main LED driver chip is
not breadboard-friendly and a PCB has to be made first.
